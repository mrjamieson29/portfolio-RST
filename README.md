# Part 1 of 2 - Portfolio of Work
In an effort to make your RST as painless as possible, we will add to it throughout the course. There is a GitHub project for your portfolio. You will create a publicly visible site that links to your learning and projects as we move through the course.

## General Directions
- Any and all code, HTML, and media must be your own. Copy and pasted content from someone/where else is not permitted. This site is to be made from scratch as you learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
  - Exceptions will be made for royalty free graphics or material obtained with express consent from the creator.
- Keep it professional. The look and content must be appropriate examples of professional work. Remember that your site is publicly visible and should reflect the expectations of a Catholic high school student. 
- Your site may have various sub-sections but it must contain the following sections at minimum:
  - **Weekly journal** - starting this week you will be required to make an entry describing what you learned that week. It can be as brief or detailed as you'd like but it should contain examples and specifics. More on this will be described in class for the first entry.
  - **Class projects** - this will have links to your submitted Replit assignments, starting with 2.1 onward. A brief description of each would also be nice. You could also link to this section from your weekly journals, if you feel it fits. 
  - **Useful bookmarks** - this will be an organized collection of useful videos, sites, tools, code snippets, etc... that you have gathered throughout the course. A great place to keep links so that you don't have one of those "there was this site I saw" moments.
  - **Final project** - this will link to Part 2 of your RST. More on that later.
